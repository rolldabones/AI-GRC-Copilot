# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository. Versions apply to the repository as a whole; all files version in lockstep. Prior versions are superseded, never silently overwritten.

## v1.1.6 - 2026-09-28

Retirement notice for the deployed custom GPT. OpenAI's Custom GPT retirement and migration FAQ, read on 28 September 2026, states that custom GPTs and their GPT pages become inaccessible on 11 December 2026. On Michael's ruling of 28 September 2026 the GPT is retired on that date and not migrated to a plugin; the instructions stay published so readers can build their own.

- **`README.md`**: retirement notice added below the deployment link, and the masthead records the retirement date. The notice cites both OpenAI help articles with the date each was read. The version moved to this release at every occurrence.
- **`CITATION.cff`**: `version` and `date-released` in lockstep.
- **The link is kept.** It is live until 11 December 2026. Striking it, and recasting the present-tense deployment wording, is `account-maintenance` RUNBOOK §8 item 28, due on the first sweep after that date.
- All other files in this repository are unchanged byte for byte.

## v1.1.5 - 2026-09-06

Citation infrastructure, doctrine citation line and lockstep maintenance. Session C of the September 2026 improvement pack, one patch release per repository across all 21 public repositories.

- **`CITATION.cff` added** in the house form settled at D-C1: no `type` field, `version` and `date-released` in lockstep with the README, `license` as the SPDX identifier for this repository's licence, `abstract` taken from this repository's ECOSYSTEM.md role line rather than newly written.
- **How to Cite block** aligned to this release and pointing at `CITATION.cff`.
- All other files in this repository are unchanged byte for byte.

## v1.1.4 - 2026-08-13

OJ text of the amending regulation obtained; Article 5 date corrected.

**Correction, not a currency update.** The release earlier today stated that the Article 5 application date of 2 February 2025 was "settled and not affected by the Omnibus". Having now read the Official Journal text, that is **wrong in part** and is corrected here.

- **The amending act is identified.** Regulation (EU) 2026/1744 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 July 2026, OJ L, 2026/1744, 24.7.2026, ELI http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2026/1744/oj, in force 27 July 2026. Article 1, point (40) amends the third paragraph of Article 113 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689.
- **The pinpoint question is answered.** Article 113 is structured in unnumbered paragraphs with lettered points. The correct citation form is **"Article 113, third paragraph, point (c)"**. "Article 113(3)" is wrong and always was. The prohibition on that form, adopted this morning as a precaution, is now replaced by a positive rule.
- **Article 5 carve-out.** Amended point (a) provides that Chapters I and II apply from 2 February 2025 **with the exception of Article 5(1), first subparagraph, points (ba) and (bb), and Article 5(1a) and (1b), which apply from 2 December 2026**. The general Article 5 date stands; the prohibitions the Omnibus added are deferred. The earlier unqualified statement is struck.
- **High-risk deferrals, verbatim.** Amended point (c): Chapter III, Sections 1, 2 and 3, with the exception of Article 6(5), apply from (i) 2 December 2027 for AI systems classified as high-risk pursuant to Article 6(2) and Annex III, and (ii) 2 August 2028 for those classified pursuant to Article 6(1) and Annex I.
- **New point (d).** Articles 102 to 110 apply from 27 July 2026.
- The OJ-text gap flag is removed from every file that carried it. That outstanding item is closed.

## v1.1.3 - 2026-08-13

License metadata sweep. An `SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0` line and the canonical Creative Commons legal code are now carried inside the existing license file. The filename is unchanged and the human-readable summary is retained above the legal code.

- The primary audience is automated intake and provenance tooling, which reads the SPDX tag rather than prose. Automated license detection previously reported nothing across all twenty-one repositories in this account.
- No change to the licence in force. The identifier records what was already true.

## v1.1.2 - 2026-08-13

Omnibus currency remediation. The Digital Omnibus on AI entered into force on 27 July 2026; notes that described Official Journal publication as pending are recast as operative law with dated amendment notes. The Article 5 application date of 2 February 2025 is stated as fact (Article 113, point (a), Article 5 sitting in Chapter II), resolving one of the standing counsel Unknowns. No pinpoint to a numbered subsection of Article 113 is given: the amending regulation's Official Journal text has not been read and its renumbering is unconfirmed, so the consolidated text is cited with an as-at date and the gap is flagged in the file.

- README.md: the EU Digital Omnibus entry recast from awaiting publication to entered into force 27 July 2026, with a dated amendment note. Annex III deferral to 2 December 2027 and Annex I deferral to 2 August 2028 stated as operative. Article 50 deployer transparency unchanged at 2 August 2026.

## v1.1.1 - 2026-07-30

### Changed
- Trademark rendering corrected to the canonical closed-up form GRCnext™. The retired spaced form "GRC next" is withdrawn from repository prose. One occurrence, in the grc line of the Part of the ecosystem section. The mirrored production instruction block is unchanged.
- Version line updated in lockstep.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-07-15

- README rebuilt as a production-verbatim mirror of the deployed AI GRC Spellbook Copilot custom GPT (Name, Description, Instruction, Conversation Starters, Capabilities), superseding the v1.0.0 "basic prompt to create this custom GPT," which had drifted from production
- Deployed-GPT link replaced: lnkd.in shortlink superseded by the direct chatgpt.com URL
- Unicode sans-serif bold characters in headings and body converted to standard Markdown; heading anchors now resolve and text is searchable and screen-reader accessible
- Added How to use it section and explicit pairing statement with AI-GRC-Master-List-of-Questions
- Added Proposed changes to production section (output staging, jurisdiction-role interrogation, disable Image Generation, Start-trigger reconciliation)
- Added dated regulatory-currency note (ISO/IEC 42001:2023 current; ISO/IEC 42005:2025 companion; EU Digital Omnibus on AI adopted, awaiting OJ publication)
- Added Part of the ecosystem section linking the canonical map and five nearest neighbors
- Added LICENSE (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) and this CHANGELOG
- Tagged v1.1.0

## v1.0.0 - baseline

- Initial README: spellbook framing, the 30 artifacts in eight groups, seed prompt for creating the custom GPT, lnkd.in link to the deployed GPT. No LICENSE, CHANGELOG or tags.
